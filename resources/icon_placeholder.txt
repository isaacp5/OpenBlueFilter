This is a placeholder file for the application icon.

For a production application, you would want to add an actual icon.png file here.
Due to text-based limitations, we can't create a real PNG icon in this session.

To create an icon:
1. Design a 256x256 PNG icon with transparency
2. Name it "icon.png" and place it in this directory
3. Create a second version named "icon_enabled.png" that appears slightly different
   (perhaps with a filter effect applied) to indicate when the filter is active
